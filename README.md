This repository is created for analysing the trending videos on YouTube and the DataSet is downloded from the open source platform i.e. Kaggle

## Data Science Project on Youtube Trending Videos Analysis with Python
The dataset that I will be using for the analysis of Youtube trending videos was collected over 205 days. For each of those days, the dataset contains data on trending videos for that day. It contains data on over 40,000 trending videos.

We will analyze the data to get insight on trending YouTube videos, to see what is common among all trending videos. This information can also be used by people who want to increase the popularity of their videos on YouTube.

## Goals of the analysis
We want to answer questions like:
- How many views do our trending videos have? Do most of them have a large number of views? Is having a large number of views required for a video to become trending?
- The same questions above, but applied to likes and comment count instead of views.
- Which video remained the most on the trendin-videos list?
- How many trending videos contain a fully-capitalized word in their titles?
- What are the lengths of trending video titles? Is this length related to the video becoming trendy?
- How are views, likes, dislikes, comment count, title length, and other attributes correlate with (relate to) each other? How are they connected?
- What are the most common words in trending video titles?
- Which YouTube channels have the largest number of trending videos?
- Which video category (e.g. Entertainment, Gaming, Comedy, etc.) has the largest number of trending videos?
